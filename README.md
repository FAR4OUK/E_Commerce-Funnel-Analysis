This project provides a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce sales funnel and marketing channel performance over a five-week period. By analyzing 5,000 unique visitors and $87,975.11 in total revenue, this analysis identifies critical bottlenecks in the customer journey and provides data-backed recommendations to optimize marketing spend and conversion efficiency.


Recommendations
1. Technical Optimization
Do Not Touch the Checkout Flow: Conversion rates from Checkout Start to Purchase are excellent (~80%+).

Maintain Architecture: Avoid redesigning the checkout page to prevent disrupting a perfectly working technical system.

2. Marketing Strategy Pivot
Social-to-Email Strategy: Shift social media budget away from direct "Sales" objectives and toward "Lead Gen" or "Retargeting".

Email Capture: Implement aggressive email capture for social visitors, as our data proves they are significantly more likely to buy once they are on the email list.

3. Financial Guardrails
Audit Ad Spend against AOV: With an AOV of ~$115 (initially found) or the current $106.51, a strict Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) limit is necessary.

CAC Limits: Set a CAC limit of $30–$40 for social media ads to ensure transactions remain profitable.


📊 Business Health & KPI Summary
During this period, the store saw 5,000 total visitors, resulting in 826 total buyers and $87,975.11 in revenue.

Average Order Value (AOV): $106.51

Overall Conversion Rate: 16.52%

Average Time to Conversion: 24 units (calculated as 11 units to cart + 13 units to purchase)

Average Revenue Per Visitor (ARPV): $17.60

🌪️ Funnel Performance & Drop-off Analysis
The funnel analysis reveals a "leaky" top-of-funnel but an exceptionally strong technical checkout process.


Top of Funnel (View to Cart): 31.06% conversion rate. This stage represents the highest volume of lost potential customers.

Mid-Funnel (Cart to Checkout): 71.02% conversion rate.

Bottom of Funnel (Payment to Purchase): 91.88% conversion rate.

Strategic Insight: Because the Payment-to-Purchase rate is so high, the technical payment flow is considered frictionless and requires no immediate redesign.

📈 Channel Attribution Audit
Not all traffic sources are equal. My analysis compared the efficiency of four primary acquisition channels to identify where the highest-quality traffic originates.

Email (The Efficiency Leader): Despite lower volume (522 views), Email boasts a massive 33.91% overall conversion rate and a 62.45% View-to-Cart rate.

Paid Ads: Steady performance with a 21.07% overall conversion rate.

Organic: The highest volume driver (2,038 views) with a healthy 16.83% conversion rate.

Social (The "Interest Gap"): While driving 30% of traffic, it has the lowest efficiency with a 6.93% overall conversion rate.

Key Takeaway: We are currently paying for "window shoppers" on Social Media. The bottleneck is the initial interest phase (only 13.59% add to cart).
